## Goal

Work faster by keeping critical visual references always visible without window switching.

## Best use cases

- Coding from design mocks
- Comparing expected vs actual UI
- Keeping test steps visible during verification

## Workflow

### 1. Capture and pin reference

1. Capture a reference image with `F2`.
2. Press `Enter` to pin the result to screen.

### 2. Tune pin window for comfort

- Resize to keep only useful area.
- Move to secondary monitor edge or corner.
- Adjust opacity so it stays visible but non-blocking.

### 3. Use multiple pins for complex tasks

Create separate pins for:

- Design target
- Current implementation
- QA acceptance criteria

### 4. Reuse pin history

When context changes frequently, open pin history and restore previous references instead of recapturing.

## Practical tips

- Keep one small pin for text requirements and one large pin for visual details.
- Use quick pin hotkey (`Shift+F2` by default) if available in your setup.
- If a pin overlaps important UI, reduce opacity before moving it.

## Quality checklist

- References stay visible throughout task execution.
- You reduce alt-tab switching frequency.
- You can restore previous references from history.
