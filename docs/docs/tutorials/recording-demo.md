## Goal

Produce a short, clear screen recording that stakeholders can understand quickly.

## Suggested duration and format

- Ideal length: 20-90 seconds
- MP4: default for most teams
- GIF/WebP: lightweight previews for chat and docs

## Workflow

### 1. Define recording scope

- Full screen for complete walkthroughs
- Region for focused demos

Start via tray menu or press `R` from region capture.

### 2. Configure before recording

In Settings > Recording, confirm:

- Frame rate and quality
- Countdown
- Audio source (mic/system)

### 3. Record with intentional pacing

1. Start recording.
2. Keep cursor movement deliberate.
3. Pause if needed before switching contexts.
4. Stop once the point is proven.

### 4. Export for the audience

- MP4 for issue trackers and presentations
- GIF/WebP for quick async updates

Use descriptive filenames:

`onboarding-flow-checkout-2026-02-24.mp4`

### 5. Attach context text

Include one paragraph with:

- What viewers should observe
- Expected result
- Actual result (if reporting a bug)

## Quality checklist

- Recording starts at the right state (no setup noise).
- Mouse movement and actions are easy to follow.
- Output format matches destination (tracker/chat/doc).
- File name and caption explain purpose.
