## Start capture

Press `F2` (default) to enter Region Capture. The cursor switches to crosshair and a magnifier panel appears.

## Selection behavior

### Precision targeting

- Magnifier provides pixel-level feedback
- Width and height are shown near the selection
- Hold `Shift` to constrain aspect ratio

### Window-aware selection

When window detection is available, SnapTray can detect the window under the cursor so you can select it with one click.

### Cancel and retry

Right-click or press `Esc` to cancel current selection.

## Multi-region workflow

Press `M` to toggle multi-region capture mode. You can collect multiple regions, then export combined or separate outputs.

## Useful shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Start Region Capture | `F2` |
| Constrain ratio | Hold `Shift` |
| Toggle multi-region | `M` |
| Start recording from region | `R` |
| Cancel | `Esc` |

## Next step

Go to [Annotation Tools](/docs/annotation-tools/) to edit captures before save/copy.
