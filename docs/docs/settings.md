## Settings tabs

### General

Launch at startup, region-capture shortcut hints, display language, toolbar style, and CLI install/uninstall.

On macOS, this tab also shows Screen Recording and Accessibility permission status with one-click system settings shortcuts.

### Hotkeys

Centralized hotkey editor by functional category.

### Advanced

Blur intensity/type and pin window defaults (opacity, zoom step, cache limits).

### Recording

Frame rate, format, quality, countdown, preview, and audio source.

### Files

Screenshot and recording folders plus filename format templates.

### OCR / Watermark / Updates

OCR language order + behavior, watermark placement/opacity/scale, and auto-check update interval.

## Recommended baseline profile

- 30 FPS MP4 for standard tutorials
- Dedicated folders for screenshots and recordings
- Auto update checks enabled weekly

## Next step

Use [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/) if any permission or output issue appears.
