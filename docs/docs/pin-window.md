## Create a pin window

You can pin from capture result (`Enter`) or from tray menu using "Pin from Image...".

## Core controls

### Mouse actions

- Drag to move
- Mouse wheel to zoom
- `Ctrl` + wheel to adjust opacity
- Drag edge to resize

### Keyboard actions

| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Rotate clockwise | `1` |
| Rotate counter-clockwise | `2` |
| Flip horizontal | `3` |
| Flip vertical | `4` |
| Close | `Esc` |

## Context menu actions

Copy, save, OCR, QR scan, live update, click-through, and close are available from right click.

## Annotation in pin window

Use the pencil icon to open a lightweight annotation toolbar dedicated to the current pinned image.

## Next step

Use [Hotkeys](/docs/hotkeys/) to bind pin actions for faster workflows.
