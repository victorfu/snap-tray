## Default hotkeys

| Action | Default |
|---|---|
| Region Capture | `F2` |
| Screen Canvas | `Ctrl+F2` |
| Paste | `F3` |
| Quick Pin | `Shift+F2` |

## Hotkey categories

Hotkeys are managed by category inside Settings:

- Capture
- Canvas
- Clipboard
- Pin
- Recording

## Conflict strategy

If your keybinding conflicts with another app:

1. Rebind action in Settings > Hotkeys.
2. Test trigger immediately.
3. Keep frequently used actions on single key combos.

## Team recommendation

For shared environments, define a standard hotkey profile and document it internally.
