## Before you begin

- macOS 14+ or Windows 10+
- Screen Recording permission granted
- Accessibility permission granted (recommended for window detection)

## First-run checklist

### 1. Launch and verify tray icon

After opening SnapTray, confirm the tray icon appears. The tray menu should show Region Capture, Screen Canvas, and Settings.

### 2. Test your first capture

Press `F2` and drag a region. You should see magnifier and size overlays while selecting.

### 3. Test quick save and copy

Inside the capture toolbar:

- Use `Ctrl/Cmd + C` to copy result
- Use `Ctrl/Cmd + S` to save result

### 4. Validate recording path

Open Settings > Files and confirm screenshot and recording output folders.

## Recommended first configuration

- Set output filename format
- Pick your preferred toolbar style
- Customize hotkeys if `F2` conflicts with other tools

## Next step

Continue with [Region Capture](/docs/region-capture/) to learn precision selection and multi-region usage.
