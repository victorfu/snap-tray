## Create a pin window

You can pin from capture result (`Enter`) or from tray menu using "Pin from Image...".

## Core controls

### Mouse actions

- Drag to move
- Mouse wheel to zoom
- `Ctrl` + wheel to adjust opacity
- Drag edge to resize

### Keyboard actions

| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Rotate clockwise | `1` |
| Rotate counter-clockwise | `2` |
| Flip horizontal | `3` |
| Flip vertical | `4` |
| Close | `Esc` |

## Context menu actions

Right-click menu includes:

- View/layout: Show Toolbar, Show Border, Move to Screen, Merge Pins, Adjust Region Layout
- Image controls: Zoom presets, image processing (rotate/flip/crop/opacity step), smoothing
- Output/workflow: Copy, Save, Open Cache Folder, Beautify, Watermark, Live Update
- Interaction/close: Click-through, Close, Close All Pins

## Annotation in pin window

Use the pencil icon to open a lightweight annotation toolbar dedicated to the current pinned image.
