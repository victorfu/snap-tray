## Does SnapTray upload my captures?

No automatic upload. Capture, annotation, and recording workflows stay local unless you explicitly use the Share URL action.

## Which output format should I use?

- MP4 for long videos and tutorials
- GIF for short loops
- WebP for lightweight animation snippets

## Why is OCR unavailable on my system?

OCR availability depends on platform capabilities and installed language packs.

## Can I customize default hotkeys?

Yes. Open Settings > Hotkeys and edit by category.

## Can I use SnapTray from scripts?

Yes. The CLI supports local capture commands and IPC-based control.

## Where should I report bugs?

Open an issue on the GitHub repository with OS version, app version, and reproducible steps.
