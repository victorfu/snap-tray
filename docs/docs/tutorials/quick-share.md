## Goal

Create a screenshot that communicates one key point and share it immediately.

## Time and setup

- Time: 30-60 seconds
- Default hotkey: `F2`
- Output: clipboard (fastest) or file (traceable)

## Workflow

### 1. Capture the exact area

1. Press `F2`.
2. Drag to select the target region.
3. Use the magnifier and dimension overlay for precision.

Tip: If your app window has clean borders, click a detected window directly instead of manual dragging.

### 2. Add one focused annotation

1. Choose `Arrow` or `Marker`.
2. Highlight only the critical area.
3. If text is needed, add one short label with `Text`.

Rule: Prefer one strong annotation over many weak marks.

### 3. Remove sensitive information

1. Select `Mosaic`.
2. Cover email addresses, IDs, or private names.

### 4. Share immediately

- `Ctrl/Cmd + C`: copy to clipboard
- Paste into chat/email/ticket
- `Share URL`: generate a share link (optional password) when external sharing is needed
- Optional: `Ctrl/Cmd + S` for file record

## Quality checklist

- The target area is tightly cropped.
- One key point is highlighted.
- Sensitive information is hidden.
- Receiver can understand the context without extra explanation.
